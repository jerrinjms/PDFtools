> Vibe coded with ChatGPT on 22 Spet 2025

This is my attempt to vibe code a simple PDF crop tool and a text to PDF generator to help with my Etsy shipping workflow.
I use a shipping platform called ChitChats in Canada to ship to US. While generating shipping labels Chit Chats always creates a PDF with the label on the left side of the landscape PDF. I usually use Photosop to crop the PDF to fit perfectly on the 4x6 in label stock I use. Well screw Adobe, now this simple website can do it and much more in a single click!

## How to use
Download the index.html file and open it using a chrominum based browser.
### PDF Crop Tool
This lets you select any PDF doc, and crop them into the standard 4x6 in shipping label format. 
_As of now it works only with labels from ChitChats. But feel free to play with the crop X, Y and zoom values to make it work with any label size_
If you selected multiple PDF files, they will be cropped and combined into one multipage PDF DOC.
### PDF Address Generator Tool
I use the same label stock to print addresses for local shipping in canada. I used to realy on Photoshop for this as well. But this couldn't be more simple.
One label can fit 3 addresses, and the forth address will be added as a new page. Text will be autofitted as long as the address is less than or equal to 5 lines of text.
