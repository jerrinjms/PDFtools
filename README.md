> Vibe coded with ChatGPT on 22 Spet 2025

This is my attempt to vibe code a simple PDF crop tool and a text to PDF generator to help with my Etsy shipping workflow.
I use a shipping platform called ChitChats in Canada to ship to US. While generating shipping labels Chit Chats always creates a PDF with the label on the left side of the landscape PDF. I usually use Photosop to crop the PDF to fit perfectly on the 4x6 in label stock I use. Well screw Adobe, now this simple website can do it and much more in a single click!
